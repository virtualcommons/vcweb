We are conducting experiments that investigate how people think, act, and make decisions and would like to invite you to participate in an online experiment. It will be scheduled over the course of 5 days where you will be able to participate by signing into the experiment website and performing virtual actions on the website. The expected time commitment is about 2 minutes a day and your participation in this study is completely voluntary.

For participating in this study, you can earn up to $25 ($5 per day) depending on the decisions you and the other participants make during the experiment. After the experiment is completed you will have until October 31st to collect your payment in person at the Tempe campus. After you've signed up for the experiment session below you will receive an email on Sunday evening, October 5th, with more detailed instructions on how to log in and the rules of the exercise. 

Please note that the start time of 12:00 AM in the session below is when the experiment will become available. You do not need to be physically present at any location in order to participate, this is a purely online experiment.
