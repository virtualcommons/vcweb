        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <div>
            The Virtual Commons is an open software initiative hosted at
            <a class='external' href='https://www.asu.edu'>Arizona State University</a>.
            We develop real-time dynamic experiments to analyze and better understand collective action issues. For
            example, sharing common resources has been a challenge for human societies for millennia. In many
            circumstances, the ability to create <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Ostrom#Design_principles_for_Common_Pool_Resource_(CPR)_institution'>effective institutional arrangements</a> has helped to avoid the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons'>tragedy of the commons</a>.
            <a href='http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/328/5978/613'>Controlled experiments</a> are
            an important instrument for increasing our understanding of how people organize themselves in cooperative
            arrangements.

        <h2>Participate in ASU research</h2>
        <p>
        If you are at least 18 years old and an undergraduate student currently enrolled at ASU you can
        <a href='{{ cas_login_url }}'>sign up</a> to the participant database that we use for randomly
        selecting participants.
        </p>
        <p>
        Typical experiments involve making decisions on a computer or on paper or answering survey questions.
        Experiments take about an hour to complete and may be conducted online or at the
        <a href='http://cbie.asu.edu/ostrom-lab/elinor-ostrom-multi-method-lab'>Elinor Ostrom Multi-Methods Laboratory</a>
        in <a href='https://maps.asu.edu/?id=120&mrkIid=62880'>Cowden Hall, Room 124</a>. Your participation in these
        experiments is entirely voluntary.  For participating in these studies, you will typically receive $5 for
        showing up, and an additional amount which can vary between $5 to $40 depending on your decisions during the
        experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
        You can sign up for experiments by logging in via <a href='{{ cas_login_url }}'>ASU's CAS authentication</a>, signing
        in with your ASURITE ID, and then filling out a brief questionnaire. When experiment sessions are available,
        randomly selected groups of individuals in our participant database will receive email invitations informing them of
        the upcoming sessions and with additional instructions on how to sign up and participate in a specific experiment
        session.
        </p>
